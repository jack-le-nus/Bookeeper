"description" : "Carolyn Jourdan, an attorney on Capitol Hill, thought she had it made. But when her mother has a heart attack, she returns home—to the Tennessee mountains, where her father is a country doctor and her mother works as his receptionist. Jourdan offers to fill in for her mother until she gets better. But days turn into weeks as she trades her suits for scrubs and finds herself following hazmat regulations for cleaning up bodily fluids; maintaining composure when confronted with a splinter the size of a steak knife; and tending to the loquacious Miss Hiawatha, whose daily doctor visits are never billed. Most important, though, she comes to understand what her caring and patient father means to her close-knit community.",

From the cradle to the cubicle, we devote more time to fixing our shortcomings than to developing our strengths.   To help people uncover their talents, Gallup introduced the first version of its online assessment, StrengthsFinder, in 2001 which ignited a global conversation and helped millions to discover their top five talents.

"description" : "Slow Cooker Recipes Cookbook. My bookname is Clark Weber. I am a Chef in New York. These are the Slow Cooker recipes that I like most. I learned some of the recipes in this cookbook from different friends and relatives. I tried all of them myself and the results were fabulous. I would also like to mention that I included in this cookbook only those slow cooker recipes which are fairly easy to cook, even though I have to admit that most of them will be ready in more than a couple of hours. This is because slow cooked meals need more cooking time compared to classic meals. But, the advantage comes from the fact that the slow cooking process is healthier and adds a great flavor to your meal. Furthermore, I selected in this cookbook only the healthiest Slow Cooker recipes that will provide you with a balanced diet. The number of calories rarely goes beyond 500/ serving (2000-2500 calories/ day intake is recommended for a sedentary adult that needs to maintain his/ her current weight), therefore these are some recipes that will help you maintain or even lose some weight. I also tried to collect here only the low carb recipes, because low carbs meals are great for dieting. Another goal of mine was to include in this cookbook only the most popular slow cooker recipes.
